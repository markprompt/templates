# AI Automations

A Next.js application that triggers automations via API calls, such as cancelling a subscription or processing a refund.

To get started, create a `.env.local` file at the root of the project, and add the following, replacing `<YOUR-PROJECT-KEY>` with your project key, which you can obtain in the Markprompt project settings:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_MARKPROMPT_PROJECT_KEY=<YOUR-PROJECT-KEY>
```

Then install dependencies and run locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
